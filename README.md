## 🧭 About

Engineer with 10+ years of experience in building and maintaining systems.  
Currently working as a **Tech Lead** (joined post-acquisition of my startup), where I manage a team and contribute to platform design and scale.

In parallel, I design and maintain trading infrastructure for personal use — focusing on stock/index options, execution logic, and data-driven strategy testing.
