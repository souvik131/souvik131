Currently working as a **Tech Lead** (joined post-acquisition of my startup), where I manage a team and contribute to platform design and scale.

In parallel, I design and maintain trading infrastructure for personal use — focusing on stock/index options, execution logic, and data-driven strategy testing.

I actively share learnings, code, and real-time market insights on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/Souvik131) to engage with the trading and tech community.
